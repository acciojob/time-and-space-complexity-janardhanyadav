 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a crucial concept in algorithm analysis, measuring the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to complete its task. It provides an estimation of the maximum time an algorithm would require to run based on the input size. Efficient algorithms strive for lower time complexity, ensuring faster execution and improved performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute, also considering how this space usage scales with the input size. One common notation used to express space complexity is 'O(n),' where 'n' represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical consideration in designing algorithms to optimize memory usage and prevent unnecessary resource consumption.
